# CampusNav

CampusNav is a smart campus navigation system designed to help students, staff, and visitors move around large school environments without stress. It provides clear directions to campus locations, reduces time wasted asking for directions, and improves the overall campus experience.

This project is built as a practical, real-world solution and can be used as an academic project, prototype, or foundation for a full campus navigation platform.
